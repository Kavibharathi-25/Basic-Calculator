The Calculator App is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, the calculator ensures smooth interaction and accurate output with real-time updates as users input numbers and operations.
The UI is styled with custom CSS, ensuring a visually appealing layout with clear display and accessible buttons.
JavaScript is used to handle all calculation logic, including parsing input values, chaining operations, handling edge cases (like divide by zero), and resetting the calculator on command.

This project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including:
DOM manipulation for button interactions and display updates
Event-driven programming using JavaScript
Responsive design principles using Flexbox
Error handling and input validation

The calculator is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices and can be easily extended to support more complex functions like percentage, square root, or memory functions in the future.
